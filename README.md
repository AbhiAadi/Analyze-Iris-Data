## Project Overview: Iris Dataset Analysis and Classification
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, consisting of features like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width, and the target variable Species. The goal is to build a machine learning model using a suitable algorithm for Iris flower classification.
